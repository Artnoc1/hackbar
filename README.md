# HackBar

HackBar is a sidebar that assists you with web application security testing, it's aim is to help make those tedious tasks a little bit easier. This add-on is a predecessor to the original HackBar that is not compatible with Firefox Quantum.

This is still a new project, so there will more than likely be lots of bugs, and missing features, if you would like to report a bug or have any suggestions, you can reach me on twitter [@totallynotdls](https://twitter.com/totallynotdls)

This is a fork and extension from build 1.0.2 of "New Hackbar" which can be found on the Firefox Add-ons Site [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-hackbar/) and on github [here](https://github.com/mxcxvn/newhackbar/)
The original add-on for non-Quantum builds is available at https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/hackbar/.
